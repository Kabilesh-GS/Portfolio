# 🌐 Kabi's Portfolio

**Hey Everyone!** Welcome to this repository. This is my personal portfolio site built with React to showcase my projects, skills, and experience in web development. Coming from a frontend background, I wanted to create something that reflects me as a developer while keeping it clean, modern, and responsive.
